# Docker: py3.7 with CUDA support

This repo is for creating docker images ([in DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ohjho)) with Python 3.7 with CUDA support so the Dockerized application can access GPU

This is basically a fork of different `Dockerfile`s from [tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo)
